# Project Description



<font size="5">Be Productive!</font>
<font size="5">Donâ€™t Burn Out!</font>

Using the Pomodoro Method will help users increase productivity.The pomodoro method gives us breaks and will help keep you on task. The Hub will help you spend those breaks without further distractions!

This project was design with the pomodoro technique in mind. The hub has a timer set to 1 pomodoro at a time of 25 minutes and 5 minutes break to follow. 
The hub is incorporated with a to-do list that will allow users to write down what they wish to accomplish in the pomodoro time they selected. A user is advised to focus on a single task from list per each pomodoro, break down complex projects, and combine small tasks. Once a pomodoro is set user must focus on task and nothing else until it rings. After every 4th pomodoro, user will have the option to select a 15 minute or 30 minute break. 

While user is on their break, the hub has APIs incorporated, such as quotes, memes, jokes to help a person relax and not be thinking on their current working task.
