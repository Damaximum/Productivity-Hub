# Project Description



<font size="5">Be Productive!</font>
<font size="5">Donâ€™t Burn Out!</font>

This app will help users focus on a task they want to do, via the Pomodoro method. For this, the app provides a timer set for the Pomodoro method, a to-do list to help break down and keep track of the task, and some fun utilities to help kill time during the break without leaving the hub.
